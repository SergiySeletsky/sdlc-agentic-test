# CDW Assistant

## Description

The CDW Agent is an autonomous AI system designed to eliminate the "Quote-to-Order" friction for complex IT infrastructure. Unlike traditional CPQ tools that rely on static "if/then" logic, the CDW Agent uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to read technical manuals, verify physical compatibility, and cross-reference real-time global inventory.

Primary Goal: Reduce complex server/rack configuration time from 3 days to 3 minutes.

Core Capabilities:
A. Natural Language to BOM (Bill of Materials) input parsing and output of complete BOM including chassis, riser cables, rail kits, PSUs.
B. Deep Compatibility Verification including thermal & power logic and physical constraints.
C. "Ghost Inventory" Prevention via multi-distributor real-time lookups and dynamic swapping of equivalent parts.

## MVP Scope

The MVP scope includes the core functionalities to parse natural language descriptions into BOMs, verify compatibility (thermal, power, and physical), and perform real-time multi-distributor inventory lookups including dynamic equivalent part swaps to avoid ghost inventory. This enables reducing configuration time significantly while ensuring validity and orderability.
