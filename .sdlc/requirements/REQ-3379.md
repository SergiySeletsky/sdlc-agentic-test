# Acceptance Criteria for Natural Language to BOM Parsing

## Statement

AC-REQ-1753-1:
Given: A valid natural language input describing server or rack configuration,
When: The system parses the input,
Then: The system SHALL output a complete BOM including chassis, riser cables, rail kits, and PSUs with all components correctly identified and structured.
Failure Mode: The system SHALL display an error message specifying the parsing failure if the input is incomplete or ambiguous.

AC-REQ-1753-2:
Given: A natural language input with uncommon or new component names,
When: The system parses the input,
Then: The system SHALL flag components as unrecognized and request user clarification or manual entry.
Failure Mode: The system SHALL not include unverified components in the BOM.

## Rationale

Define measurable acceptance criteria with error handling for natural language parsing completeness and robustness.

## Feasibility

**Risks:**
