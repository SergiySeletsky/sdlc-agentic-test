# Thermal and Power Compatibility Checks

## Statement

The system SHALL calculate the total Thermal Design Power (TDP) and verify power and cooling requirements for the selected configuration components to ensure compatibility.

## Rationale

Prevent incompatible configurations that could lead to hardware failure or inefficiency.

## Feasibility

**Risks:**
