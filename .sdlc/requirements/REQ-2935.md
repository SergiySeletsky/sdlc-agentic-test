# Acceptance Criteria for Multi-Distributor Inventory Lookup and Dynamic Part Substitution

## Statement

AC-REQ-3551-1:
Given: A list of BOM components to check inventory for,
When: The system performs inventory lookup,
Then: The system SHALL query multiple distributors in real-time and confirm availability.
Failure Mode: The system SHALL notify the user if any components are out of stock at all distributors.

AC-REQ-3551-2:
Given: A component is unavailable at the primary distributor,
When: The system performs substitution,
Then: The system SHALL automatically substitute an equivalent part from another distributor without user intervention.
Failure Mode: The system SHALL alert the user if no equivalent parts are found and block order finalization.

## Rationale

Define measurable acceptance criteria with error handling for inventory lookup and dynamic substitution to prevent ghost inventory.

## Feasibility

**Risks:**
