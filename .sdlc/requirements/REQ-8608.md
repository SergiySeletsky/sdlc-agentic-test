# Acceptance Criteria for Compatibility Verification Engine

## Statement

AC-REQ-7375-1:
Given: A generated BOM with selected components,
When: The system verifies compatibility,
Then: The system SHALL confirm all thermal, power, and physical constraints are met without conflicts.
Failure Mode: The system SHALL provide a detailed report on compatibility violations and suggest corrective actions.

AC-REQ-7375-2:
Given: A BOM with components exceeding power or thermal limits,
When: The system performs verification,
Then: The system SHALL block the configuration from proceeding until the issues are resolved.
Failure Mode: The system SHALL notify the user with specific error messages preventing order submission.

## Rationale

Define measurable acceptance criteria with error handling for compatibility verification completeness and conflict resolution.

## Feasibility

**Risks:**
